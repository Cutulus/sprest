# SharePoint 2013/Online REST Framework
An easy way to develop against the SharePoint REST api.

*Please report issues. I am constantly updating/fixing/testing to make this library better.*

## Benefits:
* Generates the REST api url and formats it for app webs automatically.
* Chain property and methods for fewer requests to the server.
* Global flag for defaulting the execution against the host web, for easier development in an app web.
* PowerShell-Like experience in the browser console. (Synchronous Requests)
* Written in TypeScript with definition file for intellisense.
